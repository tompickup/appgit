Woking Hospice was opened in December 1996 to provide palliative care and support for patients and their families living in central Surrey. The Hospice is situated in Hill View Road on the edge of Woking town. Sam Beare Hospice based within Weybridge Hospital, re-opened on August 1st 2006 under the management of Woking Hospice and provides palliative care and support to the residents of North Surrey</b></p>

<p>Hospice care is based on the belief that each person is more than their illness, and that each of us has unique physical, emotional, social and spiritual needs. Woking & Sam Beare Hospices responds to the needs of each individual, helping people achieve the best possible quality of life.</p>

<h3>Care for all</h3>
<p>This highly personal, holistic approach to care takes time, skill and experience from a multi-professional team. We care for people in the hospice, in their homes and in nursing homes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Through expert assessment and regular monitoring we aim to relieve pain, symptoms and side-effects of illness.<br /><br /></li>
<li>We enable people to receive care, treatments and therapies directly, wherever they live, through liaison with other healthcare professionals and by providing 24 hour telephone support.<br /><br /></li>
<li>We help people retain their independence, mobility and sense of control by providing practical help, equipment and advice.We help restore self confidence and well-being by giving patients the opportunity to meet socially, gain support from others in similar circumstances, and benefit from relaxation therapies.<br /><br /></li>
<li>We give patients and their loved ones opportunities to discuss their thoughts and feelings which can relieve fears and anxieties.<br /><br /></li>
<li>We help people plan for the future so that they can enjoy life as fully as possible.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Where possible we support patients&rsquo; carers by providing respite care, giving people a much needed break from their caring role.<br /><br /></li>
<li>We provide open and honest explanation to questions, enabling people to make informed choices and have greater control throughout the dying process.<br /><br /></li>
<li>We support people as their condition deteriorates, helping families, carers and friends to prepare for bereavement.<br /><br /></li>
<li>We provide ongoing support to families and carers in bereavement, from simple practical advice through to counselling services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both Hospices are separate registered charities with joint running costs of &pound;7.7 million per year. We make no charge for our services &ndash; all patient care is entirely free, and we rely on donations and other fundraising activities to fund our work.</p>
